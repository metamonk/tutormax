We're Here to Help - Rescheduling Support

Hi {{ tutor_name }},

We noticed that you've rescheduled {{ reschedule_count }} sessions in the past {{ days_period }} days, and we wanted to check in.

We're here to support you! We understand that life can be unpredictable, and we want to make sure everything is going smoothly.

Common reasons tutors reschedule frequently:
- Schedule conflicts: Need help adjusting your availability?
- Personal circumstances: Going through a busy period?
- Student matching: Not the right fit with current students?
- Technical issues: Having platform or connection problems?

How Can We Help?

We have several options to support you:
- Adjust your availability preferences
- Temporarily reduce your session load
- Connect you with different students
- Provide technical support
{% if manager_name %}- Schedule a check-in with {{ manager_name }}{% endif %}

Get support: {{ support_url }}

If you'd prefer to speak with someone directly, please reply to this email or reach out to {% if manager_name %}{{ manager_name }}{% else %}your manager{% endif %}.

Remember: We value you as a tutor and want to ensure you have the best experience possible. Don't hesitate to reach out!

Best regards,
The TutorMax Team
